    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The first software packages that implemented the [[activitypub]] protocol
      federation protocol began to appear in 2018. <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, a federated
      microblogging service, had previously implemented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OStatus">OStatus</a>
      protocol. It was ported over to using ActivityPub.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, the Mastodon team included a number of terms that the software needed to implement Mastodon features
      not defined in basic ActivityPub. Some terms were proposed for inclusion in the ActivityPub specification, but weren't included because of time constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the absence of a clear extensions process, those terms were not given their own namespace or context document, but instead were defined in the default namespace for Activity Streams 2.0.
      They also were not given their own [[JSON-LD]] context document, instead defined in the <code>@context</code>
      property of each ActivityPub object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms have been widely adopted by other ActivityPub implementations.
      Newer Mastodon-specific extensions have been defined in Mastodon's own namespace. The first few terms, though,
      remain undocumented in a formal specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/socialcg/">SocialCG</a> at the W3C is responsible for managing resources
      like the ActivityPub and Activity Streams 2.0 errata and context document. Its proposed <a
        href="https://swicg.github.io/extensions-policy/">Process for Including Extensions in Activity Streams 2.0</a>
      gives a path for widely-used extension terms to be included in the context document.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms in this Report are good candidates for that process, but miss a few key criteria. They are not defined in their own namespace. They also miss the criteria of being well-documented, and having their own context
      document at a permanent URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing the namespace for the terms would change their meaning and would not be backwards compatible. So, the current report aims to fix the two latter problems. It describes a context document for the terms, and
      defines each of the terms in a similar way to the [[activitystreams-vocabulary]] specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides documenting these terms and giving them a path to inclusion in the Activity Streams 2.0 context document, this specification also serves as a test case for the SocialCG extension inclusion process.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="context">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      The terms in this document are defined in a context document that can be used in [[JSON-LD]] documents. The
      context document is available at <a
        href="https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/miscellany">https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/miscellany</a>.
    </p>
    <p>To use these terms, documents should include this context URL in the
      <code>@context</code> property of the JSON-LD document.
    </p>
    <aside class="example">
      <p>Example usage of the context.</p>
      <pre class="json">
          {
            "@context": [
              "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
              "https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/miscellany"
            ],
            "id": "https://example.com/users/evan",
            "type": "Person",
            "name": "Evan Prodromou",
            "manuallyApprovesFollowers": false
          }
        </pre>
    </aside>
    <p>
      For backwards compatibility, the context document does <i>not</i> define a separate namespace nor a prefix for
      these terms, instead falling back to the Activity Streams 2.0 defaults. If needed for
      disambiguation, the <code>as:</code> prefix defined in the
      Activity Streams 2.0 context document can be used.

    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>This extension includes one object type, <a>Hashtag</a>.</p>

      <h3>Hashtag</h3>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="10%">
              URI:
            </td>
            <td>

                A metadata tag used for casual categorization of content. Often, a hashtag is presented inline in
              content prefixed with a hash symbol, "#". See <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag</a>. Examples are
              shown in the [[activitystreams-vocabulary]] specification under
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#microsyntaxes">Mentions, Tags, and Other Common
                Social Microsyntaxes</a> implementation notes, without a type for tag object.
                Original discussion in ActivityPub issue #<a href="https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/235">235</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <code>name</code> property MAY include an initial hash character "#".
              </p>
              <p>
                Some processors treat Hashtag objects with the same <code>name</code> as equivalent, with or without the initial hash character. For example, an aggregator service may list all objects with <code>tag</code> items of type <code>Hashtag</code> with the same <code>name</code> together, even if their <code>href</code> values differ.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the name, the Hashtag type MAY be used for metadata tags that are not implemented with inline microsyntax. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)</a>.

This is comparable to what is popularly called "NSFW" (Not Safe For Work) or "trigger warning" in some systems.  Implementations may choose to hide content flagged with this property by default, exposed at user discretion.
